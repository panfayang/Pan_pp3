Hi! Welcome to programming project three.

To compile the program, run "gcc testing.c LabelTable.c pass* getToken.c getNTokens.c helperMethods.c assemble* getInsInDec.c -o pp3.out" 
To test the program with test data, run "./pp3.out mytest"
To test with wrong input, run "./pp3.out mybad"

The program should be able to detect all the MIPS instructions listed on "http://max.cs.kzoo.edu/CS230/Projects/mipsTable.html".
